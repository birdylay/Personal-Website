description: Redesigning the logo of the Chemistry Society was quite a challenge - originally I did not want to have a beaker or the typical Bohr model as part of the logo as they were tried and generic; however, diverging from that was quite difficult as there were very few immediate recognisable symbols of Chemistry.  I first tried to find interesting chemical structures, but none of these produced the branding of a student society.  Instead, I played around with the design of the beaker and the revolving electron model.  What truly made the design feel correct for me was placing the acronyms of the Chemistry Society onto the beaker such that they appeared to be units of measurement.  The design was completed with the choice of colours (with red to represent York and blue to represent Chemistry).

description: This project was created as part of the Human Computer Interaction course offered by York University.  The course was completed abroad at the Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (ICS-FORTH) in Heraklion, Crete, Greece.  The web portal was designed and implemented with two other members and consisted of three phases.  The first phase was the prototype of the design in which the wireframes and intended functionalities were presented to the client.  The second phase involved the actual implementation.  The final phase involved the evaluation of the design through user interviews and system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire. The project attempts to demonstrate and understand standardised and effective usability principles and accessibility to the user.
